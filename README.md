# Alan J. Mabry

I have 10+ years experience as a front end software engineer.

My background in design ensures the code I deliver matches mocks and allows me to communicate effectively with designers.

I'm always learning and solving complex problems with colleagues.

Currently, I'm working on Tinka, an AI powered customer service representative.
