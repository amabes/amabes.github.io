# Alan J. Mabry

I started building web apps in 2008. Before that I was designing websites and pursuing a BFA.

I'm framework agnostic, but prefer React & NextJs to build enterprise web applications.

Currently, I'm at [CLEAR](https://www.clearme.com/business-and-partnerships) building identity verification applications used by Fortune 500 companies including [AVIS](https://www.clearme.com/partners/avis) and [LinkedIn](https://www.clearme.com/partners/linkedin).

At my previous position, I worked at [Total Brain](https://totalbrain.com), a platform to improve mental health and monitor brain performance.

My go to tech includes Javascript, React, NodeJS and Cypress.

The examples below are highlights from the past 10+ years and some current endeavors.
