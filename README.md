# Alan J. Mabry

I have 10+ years experience building web applications.

My background in design ensures the code I deliver matches mocks and allows me to communicate effectively with designers.

I'm always learning and solving complex problems with colleagues.

Currently, I'm working on [Tinka](https://www.t-mobile.at) (click pink circular button), an AI powered customer service representative.

At my previous position, I was working on [CitizenGlobal](https://corp.citizenglobal.com), a platform for digital evidence management which was sold to the F.B.I.

My go to tech includes Javascript ES6+, React, HTML and SCSS.
