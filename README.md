# Alan J. Mabry

I enjoy creating, problem solving, mentoring others and learning from my colleagues. My personality is positive and outgoing. I am the type of individual to go above and beyond what is required and follow through from start to finish.

My roots in design have served me well as the client side layer has become more important. I communicate well with non-technical persons, designers and engineers.

I thrive in agile development environments and was privileged enough to learn from one of the founders of that process while at CitizenGlobal.

I am comfortable coding in complex proprietary code bases and learning the latest greatest JavaScript frameworks.

It is important to me to be included in higher-level conversations regarding the trajectory of the product as well as UI/UX meetings to assist in determining possibilities or limitations of proposed features.

When I am not behind a computer screen, you can find me biking in the Santa Monica Mountains or surfing along our beautiful coast.
