# Alan J. Mabry

In 2008, I started building web applications professionally. Before that I was designing websites and pursuing a BFA.

I'm framework agnostic, but recently I've been using React & Redux to build enterprise apps exclusively.

I enjoy wrangling HTML & CSS to match mocks and ❤️CSS-in-JS.

Currently, I'm working on [Tinka](https://www.t-mobile.at), an AI powered customer service representative.

At my previous position, I was working on [CitizenGlobal](https://corp.citizenglobal.com), a platform for digital evidence management which was sold to the F.B.I.

My go to tech includes Javascript (ES6), React, [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) and Firebase.
